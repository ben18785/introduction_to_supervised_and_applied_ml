# Intermediate introduction to supervised machine learning and tips in applied machine learning

The lectures are as follows:

- [A survey of supervised machine learning methods](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_applied_ml/lectures/intro_to_applied_ml.html)
- [Tips in applied supervised machine learning](lectures/intro_to_ml_supervised.html)

The problem sets are as follows:

- [Supervised ML problems](problem_sets/s_problems_supervised.html) with [answers](problem_sets/s_problems_supervised_answers.html).
- [Applied ML problems](problem_sets/s_problems_applied.nb.html) which uses this [wine](problem_sets/data/winemag-data_first150k.csv) dataset. This problem is open-ended and does not have an answer set.

## Prerequisites

Students should have a good knowledge of a statistical programming language such as R or Python. They should also have a reasonable grasp of some basics from probability theory, including conditional probability and Bayes' law.
